# HGAlinker
This repository contains the code needed to run the HGAlinker algorithm. HGAlinker model is based on the attention mechanism of heterogeneous network graph. The algorithm predicts the heterogeneous edge of drug and disease nodes by integrating multiple heterogeneous graph patterns. Please refer to our paper for details.
